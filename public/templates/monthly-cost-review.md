## Agenda

### 1 · Metrics Review (15 min)

Walk through the headline numbers. The goal is shared awareness, not deep-dives.

#### Key Metrics Table (Example)

| Metric | Prior Month | Current Month | Δ (%) | Budget | Status |
|--------|------------|---------------|-------|--------|--------|
| **Total Token Spend** | $48,200 | $52,750 | +9.4% | $55,000 | 🟡 |
| **Total Tokens Consumed** | 1.24 B | 1.41 B | +13.7% | — | — |
| **Avg. Cost / 1K Requests** | $3.82 | $3.54 | −7.3% | — | 🟢 |
| **Cache-Hit Rate** | 24% | 31% | +7 pp | 30% | 🟢 |
| **Retry Token Waste** | 4.1% | 3.8% | −0.3 pp | <5% | 🟢 |
| **GPT-4o Share of Spend** | 62% | 55% | −7 pp | — | 🟢 |
| **Services Over Budget** | 1 | 2 | — | 0 | 🔴 |

#### Discussion Prompts

- Are we on track to finish the month within budget? If not, what is the projected overage?
- Which services drove the largest absolute increase in spend?
- Did any model-pricing changes from providers affect our costs this month?
- Is the traffic growth organic (more users) or systemic (longer prompts, more retries)?

### 2 · Optimization Progress (15 min)

Review active optimization initiatives and their measured impact.

#### Initiative Tracker (Example)

| # | Initiative | Owner | Status | Monthly Savings (Est.) | Monthly Savings (Actual) |
|---|-----------|-------|--------|----------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | Migrate classification to `gpt-4o-mini` | @eng-lead | ✅ Done | $4,200 | $4,850 |
| 2 | Prompt compression — support chatbot | @ml-eng | 🔄 In Progress | $2,800 | — |
| 3 | Semantic cache for FAQ answers | @platform | 🔄 In Progress | $3,500 | — |
| 4 | Batch window for data pipeline | @data-eng | 📋 Planned | $1,600 | — |
| 5 | Output token cap on email generator | @growth | ✅ Done | $900 | $1,050 |

#### Discussion Prompts

- Which completed initiative delivered the most value? Can we replicate the pattern elsewhere?
- Are any in-progress items blocked? What do they need to unblock?
- Should we re-prioritize the backlog based on this month's spend data?
- Are there new optimization opportunities we should add to the tracker?

### 3 · Budget Forecast (10 min)

Project forward based on current run-rate, known launches, and seasonal patterns.

#### Forecast Table (Example)

| Month | Projected Spend | Budget | Variance | Key Assumption |
|-------|---------------|--------|----------|----------------|
| Jun 2026 | $56,400 | $55,000 | +$1,400 | New feature launch adds ~8% traffic |
| Jul 2026 | $54,100 | $55,000 | −$900 | Cache rollout offsets growth |
| Aug 2026 | $58,200 | $57,000 | +$1,200 | Seasonal traffic peak |
| Q3 Total | $168,700 | $167,000 | +$1,700 | — |

#### Discussion Prompts

- Do we need to request a budget adjustment for next quarter?
- Are there committed-use or reserved-capacity deals we should evaluate?
- What is the impact if the new feature launch drives 2× expected traffic?
- Should we set up an automatic scale-down for non-critical services during peak cost?

---

### 4 · Priorities for Next Month (15 min)

Agree on the top 3–5 priorities for the coming month. Each must have an **owner** and a **measurable target**.

#### Priority Template

| Priority | Owner | Target | Due Date |
|----------|-------|--------|----------|
| 1. Deploy semantic cache to production | @platform | ≥30% cache hit on support chatbot | Jun 15 |
| 2. Complete prompt compression for chatbot | @ml-eng | ≥20% token reduction, <1% quality loss | Jun 20 |
| 3. Negotiate batch-pricing tier with OpenAI | @finops | Secure ≥15% discount on batch calls | Jun 30 |
| 4. Build cost-per-conversation dashboard | @analytics | Dashboard live in Looker | Jun 10 |
| 5. Onboard data-eng team to tagging standard | @platform | 100% of data pipeline calls tagged | Jun 25 |

#### Discussion Prompts

- Do these priorities reflect our biggest cost-reduction levers?
- Are owners resourced to hit these targets, or do we need to negotiate capacity?
- What is the "do nothing" cost if we defer any of these?
