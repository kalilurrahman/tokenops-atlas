## Executive Summary

### The Problem: Token Spend at Scale

Token consumption in large language model (LLM) deployments has become a first-class infrastructure cost. What begins as a pilot project—$10K/month—compounds invisibly across dozens of features, teams, and automated pipelines, reaching $400K+/month in production without any single decision triggering the increase.

Unlike cloud infrastructure costs, which engineers understand viscerally (servers, compute hours, network), token costs are abstract. An LLM API invoice reports total tokens and total cost but provides no visibility into which feature consumed them, whether they produced value, or which team is accountable.

**Three forces converge to make this urgent:**

1. **AI spend scales faster than budgets**: Token volume grows exponentially while per-token prices decline incrementally. Cost surprises are baked in.

2. **Token spend is invisible without instrumentation**: Without deliberate tagging, logging, and allocation, token economics is a black box that becomes a budget emergency.

3. **Falling prices mask rising consumption**: Organizations seeing "stable" AI invoices may be experiencing explosive token volume growth, which will surface as cost pressure once price declines flatten.

### The Solution: TokenOps

TokenOps is the operational discipline of applying FinOps principles—**visibility, allocation, optimization, and governance**—to LLM token consumption. It is FinOps for tokens.

**TokenOps enables three outcomes:**

- **Visibility**: Know exactly which services, features, teams, and use cases consume tokens and at what cost.
- **Optimization**: Reduce waste through prompt engineering, model tiering, caching, and context management—without degrading outcomes.
- **Governance**: Embed token economics into engineering culture through budgets, alerts, cost reviews, and architectural decision-making.

### Who This Guide Is For

This guide serves dual audiences:

- **Engineering & DevOps Teams**: Implementation patterns, code examples, technical strategies, instrumentation approaches.
- **Finance & FinOps Practitioners**: Allocation frameworks, unit economics, governance structures, budget models.
- **Product & Executive Leaders**: Business justification, ROI calculation, risk management, organizational design.

## Part 1: Foundations

### 1.1 What Are Tokens?

An LLM processes input as **tokens**—discrete units of text. A token is roughly 4 characters of English text, though the exact mapping varies by model and tokenizer.

**Example tokenization:**
```
"What is the capital of France?"
↓
[4, 5, 16, 5, 1, 1289, 4, 4843, 8] 
(9 tokens)
```

Every LLM API call involves two token types:

| Token Type | Definition | Billing |
|---|---|---|
| **Input Tokens** | All text sent to the model: system instructions, context, prompt, history | Charged at base rate |
| **Output Tokens** | The model's generated response | Charged at higher rate (typically 2-10x input rate) |

**Input tokens include:**
- System prompt (e.g., "You are an expert analyst...")
- Retrieved context (RAG documents, knowledge base extracts)
- Conversation history (all prior turns)
- User query
- Instructions for output format

**Output tokens include:**
- The entire model response (regardless of relevance)
- Tool calls or function invocations
- Reasoning chains (if reasoning tokens are enabled)

### 1.2 Token Pricing Models

Token pricing varies significantly by model, provider, and volume tier.

**Provider Comparison (as of May 2026):**

| Provider | Model | Input Rate | Output Rate | Output Premium |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OpenAI | GPT-4o | $5/1M | $15/1M | 3x |
| Anthropic | Claude 3.5 Sonnet | $3/1M | $15/1M | 5x |
| Google | Gemini 2.0 Flash | $0.075/1M | $0.30/1M | 4x |
| Meta | Llama 3.1 (via third-party) | $0.40/1M | $0.60/1M | 1.5x |

**Volume tiers** offer 20-50% discounts at enterprise scale. Batch processing APIs cost 50% less than real-time pricing by design, as they queue requests for processing during off-peak hours.

### 1.3 The Economics of Scale

Token costs compound invisibly. Consider this scenario:

**Day 1 (Pilot): Single Feature, One Team**
- Daily calls: 10,000
- Avg tokens/call: 2,000 input + 500 output
- Daily cost: 10,000 × (2,000 × $0.003 + 500 × $0.015) = **$135/day = ~$4,000/month**

**Month 6 (Production): Multiple Features, Multiple Teams**
- Daily calls across all features: 500,000
- Avg tokens/call: 2,000 input + 500 output
- Daily cost: 500,000 × (2,000 × $0.003 + 500 × $0.015) = **$6,750/day = ~$200,000/month**

**No single decision triggered this 50x increase.** It accumulated across:
- 5 new features launched (each consuming tokens)
- 3 teams using internal AI tools
- 2 automated pipelines (data enrichment, quality scoring)
- 1 chatbot (high-volume, low-margin)

And here's the trap: **without instrumentation, you might not notice until the invoice arrives.**

### 1.4 Token Yield Rate (The Core Metric)

The single most important metric in TokenOps is **token yield rate**:

```
Token Yield Rate = (Valuable Output Tokens) / (Total Consumed Tokens) × 100%
```

Valuable tokens are those that contribute to a decision, action, or outcome that the user or downstream system acts upon.

Low-yield token consumption includes:
- **Retried calls** due to API errors or timeouts
- **Discarded outputs** that don't meet quality thresholds
- **Irrelevant context** retrieved but not used in reasoning
- **Hallucinated content** that's filtered out before use
- **Duplicate processing** (same data processed multiple times)

**Target: 80%+ token yield rate.** Below that, your optimization opportunities are large.

## Part 2: The TokenOps Framework

### 2.1 The FinOps Analogy

FinOps brought financial accountability to cloud computing by establishing three principles:

1. **Inform**: Visibility into who is using what, and at what cost
2. **Optimize**: Making cost-conscious architectural decisions
3. **Operate**: Continuous cost management through budgets, alerts, reviews

TokenOps mirrors this framework exactly, one layer up the stack:

| FinOps (Cloud) | TokenOps (LLM) | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Tag all resources | Tag all API calls | Metadata: team, service, feature, environment |
| Build cost allocation reports | Build token allocation reports | Join metadata with billing data |
| Compare cost per unit of value | Compare cost per request/outcome | Unit economics: $/request, $/user, $/outcome |
| Set budgets and alerts | Set token budgets and alerts | Enforce guardrails at the API gateway |
| Architecture reviews | Model selection reviews | Cost vs. quality tradeoff validation |

### 2.2 The Five Layers of Token Spend

Token spend in production systems has five distinct layers, each with its own cost driver and optimization lever.

#### **Layer 1: System Prompt Overhead (10-30% of total spend)**

The system prompt is the foundational instruction that controls model behavior. It is included in **every single API call** to that endpoint.

**Example system prompt (1,200 tokens):**
```
You are an expert financial analyst specialized in SEC filings 
and corporate earnings reports. Your role is to extract key 
metrics, identify trends, and provide actionable insights for 
investment decisions.

Follow these rules:
1. Only cite specific numbers from the filing
2. Flag any anomalies or unusual patterns
3. Provide 3-5 bullet points per analysis
4. Use JSON format: {findings, risks, opportunities}
5. If data is ambiguous, request clarification rather than assume
...
[continues for 1,200 tokens]
```

**The cost multiplier:**
- Endpoint receives: 100,000 daily calls
- System prompt: 1,200 tokens per call
- Daily system prompt tokens: 100,000 × 1,200 = **120 million tokens/day**
- Monthly cost: 120M × 30 × $0.003 = **$10,800/month** (before a single user query)

**Optimization lever: Prompt compression**
- Remove redundant instructions
- Replace verbose examples with concise rules
- Use templating (fill values at call time, not in prompt)
- Typical compression: 20-50% reduction without quality loss

**Compressed example:**
```
You are a financial analyst. Extract metrics from SEC filings.
Rules: cite specific numbers | flag anomalies | JSON: {findings, risks, opportunities}
Ambiguous data → request clarification.
```

Achieves 75% reduction while maintaining quality.

#### **Layer 2: Context and Memory (20-50% of total spend)**

Context is the retrieved or accumulated information passed to the model for reasoning. This is usually the **highest-leverage optimization layer**.

**Context sources:**
- **RAG retrieval**: Document chunks retrieved by vector search
- **Agent memory**: Tool results, reasoning traces, prior actions
- **Conversation history**: All prior turns in a multi-turn dialog
- **Knowledge base**: Structured metadata about entities

**The problem:**
- RAG retrieves top-10 document chunks but the model only needs 2-3
- Conversation history grows with every turn; after 20 turns, earlier context becomes noise
- Agent reasoning chains accumulate tool calls that don't inform the final decision

**Example: Customer support chatbot**

Turn 1:
```
User: "Why was I charged twice?"
System includes: Full customer history (50 transactions), billing terms (5 pages), 
ticket history (30 prior tickets), knowledge base (1,000 articles)
Relevant: Last 2 transactions, relevant billing rule (1 article)
Waste: 95% of context
```

Turn 2:
```
User: "I need to update my payment method"
System includes: Entire prior turn + full chat history
Relevant: Current context only
Waste: 80% of accumulated context
```

**Optimization lever: Context trimming & summarization**
- Retrieve only top-3 most relevant chunks (not top-10)
- Summarize conversation history after 5 turns: "User inquired about double charge on 2024-05-15. Issue identified as billing cycle overlap."
- Filter knowledge base by relevance threshold (only include chunks >85% similar to query)
- Implement sliding window: keep only last 10 turns, summarize older turns

**Impact: 30-60% input token reduction with zero quality loss**

#### **Layer 3: Model Selection (Varies; 10-50%+ of total spend)**

Model cost per token varies by 10-50x depending on the model's sophistication.

**Model comparison (simplified):**

| Model | Input Cost | Output Cost | Best For | Relative Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Llama 3.1 70B | $0.40/1M | $0.60/1M | Simple classification, extraction | 1x |
| GPT-4o Mini | $0.15/1M | $0.60/1M | General tasks, slight upgrade | 2x |
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | $3/1M | $15/1M | Complex reasoning, nuance | 15x |
| GPT-4 Turbo | $10/1M | $30/1M | Frontier performance | 50x |

**The mistake: Using frontier models for all tasks**

A common pattern: teams deploy a single frontier model (e.g., GPT-4) for all use cases—classification, extraction, summarization, complex reasoning. Frontier models are optimized for the hardest problems, not the easiest ones.

**The opportunity: Model tiering**

Evaluate each use case:
- **Classification** ("Is this customer positive/negative/neutral?"): 98%+ accuracy at Llama-level
- **Extraction** ("Pull the dollar amounts from this contract"): 99%+ accuracy at Llama-level
- **Summarization** ("Summarize earnings report"): 95%+ accuracy at mid-tier
- **Complex reasoning** ("Analyze investment opportunity"): Requires frontier model for nuance

**Routing logic:**
```
Input: task + quality requirements
If task == "classification" → use Llama (cheapest)
Else if task == "extraction" → use GPT-4o mini
Else if task == "summarization" → use mid-tier model
Else if task == "complex reasoning" → use frontier model
```

**Impact: 30-60% cost reduction in blended per-token cost**

#### **Layer 4: Output Length (15-35% of total spend)**

Output tokens are priced higher than input tokens on most pricing schedules. Output length variance is high without constraints.

**Examples of uncontrolled output:**
- User asks: "Summarize this 50-page report"
- Model generates: 3,000 tokens (to be thorough)
- Cost: 3,000 × $0.015 = $0.045 per request

**With output constraints:**
- Request: "Summarize in 5 bullet points"
- Model generates: 300 tokens (structured format)
- Cost: 300 × $0.015 = $0.0045 per request
- **Savings: 90% on this request**

**Optimization lever: Output format constraints**

Instead of: "Write a summary"
Use: "Return JSON: {title, key_findings: [3 items], risk_level: enum}"

Or: "Provide 5 bullet points, max 100 characters each"

Or: "True/False with one-sentence explanation"

**Additional benefit:** Structured outputs are more reliable for programmatic processing. You eliminate the parsing step where malformed outputs cause retries.

**Impact: 20-40% reduction in output token consumption**

#### **Layer 5: Retry and Error Overhead (5-20% of total spend)**

Retried calls, fallback prompts, and error correction loops consume tokens without producing usable results.

**Sources of retry overhead:**
- API timeouts (retry with same prompt)
- Malformed output (retry with stricter format instruction)
- Hallucinations (retry with additional constraints)
- Token limit exceeded (retry with shorter context)
- Rate limit hits (queue and retry)

**Example:**
- Original request: 1,000 input tokens → 500 output tokens
- Output doesn't parse as JSON (retry #1): 1,000 input + 500 output
- Output missing required field (retry #2): 1,000 input + 500 output
- Success: 1,000 input + 450 output (correct format)
- **Total cost: 4,000 input + 1,950 output = 5,950 tokens for what should be 1,450 tokens**
- **Waste: 4x token consumption**

**Optimization lever: Error handling & caching**

- **Deterministic prompts**: Same input should always produce valid output (use structured format + validation)
- **Semantic caching**: Cache successful responses; serve cached results for similar queries (saves 40-80% on repetitive workloads)
- **Graceful degradation**: If API fails, return cached result or simplified response (no retry overhead)
- **Batch validation**: Validate output schema before counting toward quota

**Impact: 10-20% reduction through better error handling; 40-80% reduction through caching on high-repetition workloads**

### 2.3 Summary: Token Spend Layers

| Layer | % of Spend | Primary Lever | Potential Savings |
|---|---|---|---|
| System Prompt Overhead | 10-30% | Prompt compression | 20-50% |
| Context & Memory | 20-50% | Context trimming | 30-60% |
| Model Selection | Varies | Model tiering | 30-60% |
| Output Length | 15-35% | Format constraints | 20-40% |
| Retry & Error | 5-20% | Error handling | 10-20% |

## Part 3: Implementation Playbook

### 3.1 Phase 1: Baseline Audit (Weeks 1-2)

Before optimizing, you must measure.

**Step 1: Inventory all LLM API calls**

Identify every service and pipeline calling an LLM API:
- Web application features (chatbots, generators, analyzers)
- Backend services (data enrichment, quality scoring, recommendations)
- Automated pipelines (batch processing, scheduled jobs)
- Internal tools (data analysis, report generation)

**Output:** Spreadsheet with:
- Service/feature name
- API endpoint
- Model(s) in use
- Team responsible
- Estimated call volume (daily/monthly)
- Use case (classification, generation, reasoning, etc.)

**Step 2: Calculate current baseline costs**

Pull data from your LLM provider's API logs or billing dashboard:
- Total tokens consumed (input + output)
- Total cost
- Average tokens per call
- Output token ratio (output ÷ total)

**Formula:**
```
Blended Cost Per Token = Total Cost / Total Tokens
```

Example:
```
Total monthly tokens: 10 billion
Total monthly cost: $15,000
Blended cost: $15,000 / 10B = $0.0015 per token
```

**Step 3: Identify high-value optimization targets**

Not all token consumption is created equal. Prioritize by:
- **Size**: Features consuming the most tokens (biggest bang for buck)
- **Repeatable**: Use cases with high call volume (compound savings)
- **Low risk**: Optimizations unlikely to degrade quality

**Quick priority scoring:**
```
Priority Score = (Monthly Tokens) × (Estimated Savings %) / (Quality Risk)
```

High-priority targets:
- System prompts on high-volume endpoints (100K+ daily calls)
- RAG pipelines retrieving excessive context
- Batch jobs still using real-time pricing
- Frontier models on low-complexity tasks

---

### 3.2 Phase 2: Instrumentation (Weeks 2-4)

Instrumentation is the foundation of allocation and optimization.

**Step 1: Define tagging schema**

Every LLM API call must include metadata. Minimum schema:

```json
{
  "team": "marketing",
  "service": "email-generator",
  "feature": "subject-line-optimization",
  "environment": "production",
  "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "use_case": "content-generation",
  "cost_center": "product-marketing",
  "region": "us-east-1"
}
```

**Step 2: Instrument at the API gateway**

Don't rely on individual services to tag calls. Use a centralized LLM gateway (LiteLLM, LangChain proxy, or custom middleware) that:
- Intercepts all LLM API calls
- Adds metadata automatically (by service + feature)
- Logs to observability system (DataDog, New Relic, Splunk)
- Enforces rate limits and budgets

**Example gateway configuration:**
```yaml
services:
  email_generator:
    features:
      subject_line_optimization:
        model: gpt-4o-mini
        max_tokens_per_day: 100M
        timeout: 5s
        tags:
          team: marketing
          cost_center: product-marketing
```

**Step 3: Set up cost tracking**

Join metadata logs with provider billing data:
- Daily: Export logs from gateway
- Daily: Pull token counts from provider API
- Join on: timestamp, model, tokens
- Store in data warehouse (BigQuery, Snowflake, etc.)

**Output:** Allocation reports queryable by:
- Team
- Service
- Feature
- Model
- Use case
- Time period

---

### 3.3 Phase 3: Allocation & Reporting (Weeks 3-5)

With instrumentation in place, build allocation reports.

**Step 1: Calculate token costs by dimension**

Using the cost data warehouse:

```sql
SELECT
  team,
  service,
  feature,
  SUM(input_tokens) AS total_input_tokens,
  SUM(output_tokens) AS total_output_tokens,
  SUM(cost) AS total_cost,
  ROUND(SUM(cost) / SUM(input_tokens + output_tokens), 6) AS blended_cost_per_token,
  COUNT(*) AS total_calls
FROM token_logs
WHERE date >= CURRENT_DATE - 30
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
ORDER BY 6 DESC
```

**Output:** Cost allocation by team, service, feature

**Step 2: Define chargeback model**

Decide: will you charge teams back for token costs, or simply report them?

- **Chargeback**: Teams pay from their own budget. Strong incentive to optimize. Risk: teams optimize the wrong way (by degrading quality).
- **Showback**: Informational only. Less political friction. Risk: no real incentive to optimize.
- **Hybrid**: Platform covers baseline; overage charged back.

**Recommendation for starting:** Showback for 3 months while teams learn to optimize, then transition to chargeback.

**Step 3: Build dashboard**

Create a self-serve dashboard accessible to all stakeholders:

**For Engineers:**
- Cost breakdown by service/feature
- Model usage distribution
- Token yield rate by use case
- Anomaly alerts (unusual spike)
- API error rates (indicator of retry overhead)

**For Finance:**
- Team-level cost allocation
- Trend lines (are we optimizing or growing faster than expected?)
- Budget vs. actual
- Cost per user, per request, per outcome

**For Product:**
- Cost per feature
- Cost vs. revenue (if available)
- Unit economics ($/paying user, for monetized features)

---

## Part 4: Optimization Strategies

### 4.1 Model Tiering & Routing

**Objective:** Route each request to the cheapest model that meets quality requirements.

**Process:**

1. **Establish quality baselines**
   - Define success metrics for each use case (accuracy, F1 score, human eval rating, etc.)
   - Benchmark all available models
   - Identify the cheapest model meeting the threshold

2. **Build routing logic**
   - Create a decision tree or scoring function
   - Route based on: task type, complexity signals, user tier, context available

3. **Implement A/B testing**
   - Shadow-test cheaper models on a percentage of traffic
   - Compare quality metrics
   - Roll out gradually

**Example: Classification task**

Baseline: Using GPT-4o for customer sentiment classification
- Model: GPT-4o
- Accuracy: 97%
- Cost: $0.0075 per call (2K input + 100 output tokens)

Test: Evaluate cheaper models
- Llama 3.1 70B: 94% accuracy, $0.00008 per call (95% cheaper)
- GPT-4o Mini: 96% accuracy, $0.00025 per call (97% cheaper)
- Claude 3.5 Haiku: 95% accuracy, $0.0002 per call (97% cheaper)

**Decision:**
- For important decisions (chargeback disputes, litigation holds): use GPT-4o (97% accuracy)
- For routine classification: use GPT-4o Mini (96% accuracy, 97% cost reduction)
- For bulk background scoring: use Llama (94% accuracy, 99% cost reduction)

**Impact:** 60-70% cost reduction on this use case

### 4.2 Semantic Caching

**Objective:** Avoid recomputing the same results for similar queries.

Semantic caching stores LLM responses indexed by query meaning (not exact string match), and serves cached results for sufficiently similar subsequent queries.

**How it works:**

```
User Query 1: "What is Claude's context window?"
↓ [embed query] → [search index]
↓ [cache miss] → [call Claude API]
↓ [store in cache with embedding]

User Query 2: "What's the maximum tokens Claude can handle?"
↓ [embed query] → [search index]
↓ [cosine similarity > 0.95] → [CACHE HIT]
↓ [serve cached response]
```

**Implementation:**

1. **Choose caching layer**
   - Redis (simple, in-memory)
   - pgvector (Postgres with vector search)
   - Pinecone (managed vector DB)
   - Or built into LLM API (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)

2. **Set similarity threshold**
   - Threshold: 0.90 similarity → serve cache (90% confident similar)
   - Below 0.90 → fresh API call + new cache entry

3. **Monitor cache hit rate**
   - Track what % of queries hit cache
   - Typical for FAQ: 60-80% hit rate
   - Typical for unique requests: 10-30% hit rate

**Supported use cases:**
- FAQ & documentation lookups (80%+ hit rate expected)
- Product description generation (60%+ hit rate)
- Repetitive extraction tasks (40%+ hit rate)
- Real-time chatbots (10-20% hit rate)

**Impact:** 40-80% token savings on high-repetition workloads; 10-20% on unique queries

### 4.3 Context Window Management

**Objective:** Prevent input token costs from growing linearly with conversation length.

**The problem:**

```
Turn 1: User query (500 tokens) + context (1000 tokens) = 1,500 tokens input
Turn 2: User query (500 tokens) + context (1000 tokens) + Turn 1 (1,500 tokens) = 3,000 tokens input
Turn 3: User query (500 tokens) + context (1000 tokens) + Turn 1 + Turn 2 = 4,500 tokens input
...
Turn 10: Input tokens = 12,500 tokens

Cost per turn = $0.0375 (turn 1) → $0.1875 (turn 10) = 5x increase
```

**Solutions:**

**1. Sliding Window**
```
Keep only last N turns:
Turn 10: Only include last 3 turns + new query = 4,500 tokens (constant cost)
```

**2. Conversation Summarization**
```
After 5 turns, summarize prior conversation:
Instead of: [turn 1, turn 2, turn 3, turn 4, turn 5, turn 6]
Store: [summary of turns 1-5, turn 6]
Saves: 30-50% input tokens while preserving context
```

**3. Hierarchical Memory**
```
System memory: Key decisions and facts (always included)
Recent memory: Last 2 turns (always included)
Long-term memory: Older turns (compress via summarization)

Example:
System: "User is analyzing 2024 Q3 earnings. Key metrics: revenue $10B, growth 15%"
Recent: "User asked about margin trends. Discovered compression in Q3."
Input: "What does this mean for Q4 guidance?"
```

**Impact:** 30-50% input token reduction while maintaining conversation context

### 4.4 Batch Processing

**Objective:** Route non-latency-sensitive workloads to batch APIs, which cost 50% less.

**When to use batch:**
- Nightly data enrichment (add customer segment, industry classification)
- Bulk document processing (review contracts, extract terms)
- Periodic report generation
- Training data generation or cleaning
- Offline analysis

**Batch vs. Real-time pricing:**

| Workload | Real-time API | Batch API | Savings |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1M embeddings overnight | $3,000 | $1,500 | 50% |
| 100K document analysis | $300 | $150 | 50% |
| Daily data enrichment | $5,000 | $2,500 | 50% |

**Implementation:**

1. **Identify batch-suitable workloads**
   - Review all use cases
   - Label: latency-sensitive vs. non-latency-sensitive

2. **Queue batch requests**
   - Collect requests in a queue (S3, database, etc.)
   - Submit to batch API (OpenAI Batch, Anthropic, etc.)
   - Poll for completion status
   - Process results

3. **Cost tracking**
   - Tag batch requests differently in cost logs
   - Measure time-to-completion vs. cost saved
   - Ensure batch delays are acceptable to users

**Example implementation:**
```python
# Queue enrichment task
enqueue_batch(
  requests=[
    {"customer_id": 1, "industry": "tech"},
    {"customer_id": 2, "industry": "finance"},
    ...
  ],
  model="gpt-4o-mini",
  endpoint="/v1/batch",
  description="customer_segment_classification"
)

# Poll for results (next morning)
results = get_batch_results(batch_id)
```

**Impact:** 50% cost reduction on batch-suitable workloads (typically 20-30% of total volume)

### 4.5 Prompt Engineering & Compression

**Objective:** Remove redundancy and verbosity from system prompts without degrading output quality.

**Techniques:**

**1. Remove example verbosity**
```
❌ Before (500 tokens):
"For instance, if the input is 'I love this product' with sentiment 
classification task, the expected output format is:
{
  'sentiment': 'positive',
  'confidence': 0.95,
  'keywords': ['love', 'product']
}
Only include keywords that directly contributed to the sentiment decision."

✅ After (100 tokens):
"Format: {sentiment, confidence, keywords}. Example: {'sentiment': 'positive', 'confidence': 0.95, 'keywords': ['love']}"
```

**2. Use templating instead of static examples**
```
❌ Before: Hard-code all examples in prompt
System prompt = 2,000 tokens (always sent)

✅ After: Template with values injected at call time
System prompt = 500 tokens + injected template values
```

**3. Consolidate instructions**
```
❌ Before (300 tokens):
"You are an expert financial analyst.
You specialize in reading SEC filings.
You extract key metrics.
You identify trends.
You provide investment insights.
Always cite specific numbers.
Always flag anomalies.
Always use JSON format."

✅ After (50 tokens):
"Financial analyst. Extract metrics from SEC filings. Flag anomalies. JSON: {metrics, trends, insights}. Cite numbers."
```

**4. Use programmatic constraints instead of rules**
```
❌ Before (instruction in prompt):
"Never exceed 300 characters per bullet point"

✅ After (enforced in code):
output = model.generate(...)
bullets = [b[:300] for b in output.split('\n')]
```

**Compression targets:**
- Reduction: 20-50% typical
- Quality impact: Validate via A/B testing on 10%+ of traffic
- Tools: Use automated prompt optimization services (e.g., DSPy, Optillm)

**Impact:** 10-30% cost reduction on system prompt overhead

## Part 5: Unit Economics & Metrics

### 5.1 The Metrics Framework

Unit economics connect raw token consumption to business outcomes. They enable the three key conversations:

1. **Budget conversations:** "Should we increase the token budget to 15B/month?"
2. **Feature decisions:** "Should we launch feature X if it costs $50K/month?"
3. **Optimization trade-offs:** "Should we degrade quality slightly to save 30% cost?"

### 5.2 Key Metrics by Audience

#### **For Engineering Teams**

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Cost per request | Total cost / Request count | Monitor for anomalies |
| Tokens per request | Total tokens / Request count | Should stabilize over time |
| Token yield rate | Valuable tokens / Total tokens | > 80% |
| Cache hit rate | Cache hits / Total requests | Varies by use case |
| API error rate | Failed calls / Total calls | < 1% |

**Dashboard:**
```
Today's Metrics:
- Cost per request: $0.0045 (up 12% from yesterday)
- Tokens per request: 2,100 (stable)
- Token yield: 82% (good)
- Cache hit rate: 65% (strong for FAQ)
- Error rate: 0.3% (acceptable)

Alert: Cost per request spiked 12%. Investigate model changes or prompt growth.
```

#### **For Finance & FinOps**

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Cost by team | Sum of costs per team | For chargeback/allocation |
| Cost trend | Month-over-month change | Should be flat or declining (if optimizing) |
| Cost per feature | Sum of costs per feature | Prioritize high-cost features for optimization |
| Token velocity | Tokens consumed per day | Should show optimization flattening curve |
| Blended cost per token | Total cost / Total tokens | Target 20-30% reduction YoY |

**Dashboard:**
```
Team Cost Allocation (May 2026):
- Marketing: $15,000 (35%)
- Product: $18,000 (42%)
- Data Science: $10,000 (23%)

Token Velocity:
- May 1-10: 50B tokens/day
- May 11-20: 48B tokens/day (96% of prior period, optimization working)
- May 21-31: 46B tokens/day (96% of prior period)

Trend: Stable consumption despite 10% feature growth (good productivity)
```

#### **For Product & Business**

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Cost per user | Total cost / Active users | For paid features |
| Cost per outcome | Total cost / Desired outcomes | E.g., $/successful recommendation |
| Feature margin | Revenue - Token cost | For profit-bearing features |
| Token cost as % of feature revenue | Token cost / Feature revenue | < 10% for healthy margins |

**Dashboard:**
```
Feature Unit Economics:

Email Generator (Paid Feature):
- Monthly revenue: $50,000
- Monthly token cost: $3,000
- Token cost % revenue: 6% (healthy)
- Cost per email: $0.02

- Queries/month: 10M
- Cost per query: $0.0025
- Savings vs. manual: $100,000/month (opportunity cost)
```

### 5.3 Dashboarding & Alerting

**Essential dashboard views:**

1. **Real-time overview**
   - Today's cost (YTD, month-to-date)
   - Main cost drivers (top 3 services)
   - Anomalies (spike detection)

2. **Trend analysis**
   - Cost trend (last 30 days, 90 days, YTD)

   - Blended cost per token trend

3. **Allocation breakdown**
   - Cost by team (waterfall or pie chart)
   - Cost by model (efficiency comparison)
   - Cost by use case

4. **Optimization tracking**
   - Estimated savings from each optimization
   - ROI of optimization investments
   - Quality metrics alongside cost

**Alerts to set up:**

| Alert | Condition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Cost anomaly | Daily cost > avg + 2σ | Page on-call engineer |
| Budget overrun | Spend > 80% of monthly budget | Finance review |
| Model drift | Avg cost per token rises 5% | Investigation |
| Error rate spike | Errors > 2% of requests | Page on-call |
| Cache miss rate drop | Cache hit rate < historical avg - 20% | Engineering review |

## Part 6: Governance & Culture

### 6.1 TokenOps Organizational Structure

**Typical TokenOps team structure (for large organizations):**

- **TokenOps lead** (reporting to VP Engineering or Director FinOps)
  - Owns TokenOps strategy and roadmap
  - Facilitates cost discussions across teams
  - Drives optimization priorities

- **Platform engineer** (instrumentation & tooling)
  - Maintains LLM gateway
  - Builds dashboards and allocation reports
  - Manages cost tracking infrastructure

- **Finance partner** (cost analysis & budgeting)
  - Owns cost allocation
  - Builds unit economics
  - Manages budgets and forecasting

### 6.2 Embedding TokenOps into Engineering Culture

**Token budgets (the key governance lever):**

Every production AI workload should have an explicit token budget with automated enforcement:

```
Service: customer-support-chatbot
Feature: email-classification
Monthly token budget: 10 billion tokens
Hard limit: 11 billion (110%)
Alert threshold: 8 billion (80%)
Owners: [person1@company.com, person2@company.com]
Escalation: VP Product (if budget overrun)

Current: 6.2B tokens (62% of budget)
Forecast: 9.8B tokens at current growth rate
Status: On track
```

**Budget enforcement:**
- Soft alerts at 80% (team notified, optional action)
- Hard limit at 100% (API calls throttled or fail)
- Requires approval from finance to increase budget

**Token budget review cycle:**
- Monthly: Review actual vs. forecast
- Quarterly: Adjust budgets based on business plans
- Annually: Set budget targets aligned to growth plans

### 6.3 Architecture Review Process

**TokenOps questions in architecture reviews:**

Before launching a new AI feature:

1. **Cost baseline**: What are the estimated tokens per request? Per day?
2. **Unit economics**: What's the cost per user, per outcome, per feature revenue?
3. **Model selection**: What's the cheapest model that meets quality requirements?
4. **Scaling assumption**: How does cost scale with success (good problem to have)?
5. **Optimization plan**: What's the roadmap for optimization (prompt compression, caching, model tiering)?
6. **Risk**: What happens if token costs double? Triple?

**Architecture decision record template:**

```
# Architecture Decision: Customer Support Chatbot

## Part 7: Case Studies & Scenarios

### Case Study 1: SaaS Company Launches Chatbot

**Situation:**
- Company: B2B SaaS platform (CRM)
- New feature: AI-powered customer support chatbot
- Model chosen: GPT-4o (standard choice, not evaluated)
- Pilot results: Feature is working, users like it

**Baseline metrics:**
- Monthly token consumption: 500M
- Monthly cost: $750
- Tokens per conversation: 5,000 (2K input + 3K output)
- Daily calls: 100,000

**Problem discovered after 3 months in production:**
- Monthly token consumption: 5B (10x increase)
- Monthly cost: $7,500
- Did not plan for scale or optimize

**Optimization applied:**

1. **Prompt compression** (500 tokens → 300 tokens)
   - Removed redundant examples
   - Compressed instructions
   - **Impact: 40% reduction on system prompt layer (10-30% of total spend)**

2. **Context trimming** (4 prior turns → 2 prior turns)
   - Implemented sliding window
   - Summarized older turns
   - **Impact: 35% reduction on context layer (20-50% of total spend)**

3. **Model tiering**
   - Evaluated GPT-4o Mini on FAQ-related queries (80% of traffic)
   - Accuracy: 96% vs. 99% for GPT-4o (acceptable)
   - Route: FAQ → GPT-4o Mini, Complex → GPT-4o
   - **Impact: 50% reduction on model layer (varies, but this traffic = 60% of spend)**

4. **Output constraints**
   - Changed from free-form to JSON + 3 bullet-point limit
   - Reduced output variance
   - **Impact: 30% reduction on output layer (15-35% of total spend)**

5. **Semantic caching** (for FAQ)
   - Added Redis semantic cache
   - Hit rate: 62% on FAQ traffic (40% of all traffic)
   - **Impact: 25% overall reduction (40% of traffic × 62% × 50% cache savings)**

**Results:**
- Original: $7,500/month
- After optimizations: $2,200/month
- **Savings: 71% cost reduction**
- Quality: Slight improvement (from 96% to 97% due to better prompt engineering)
- Revenue impact: Feature maintained growth trajectory with 70% lower cost

### Case Study 2: Data Enrichment Pipeline

**Situation:**
- Company: Data analytics platform
- Use case: Nightly job enriches customer data with classification (industry, size, intent)
- Current: Real-time API calls, processing 1M records/night
- Problem: $5,000/month spend on non-urgent work

**Baseline:**
- Real-time API: $3/1M input tokens + $15/1M output tokens
- 1M records/night × 300 tokens/record = 300M tokens
- Monthly cost: 300M × 30 × $0.0045 = $4,050

**Optimization:**
- Switch to batch API: $1.5/1M input tokens + $7.5/1M output tokens
- Same 300M tokens/night
- Monthly cost: 300M × 30 × $0.00225 = $2,025
- **Savings: $2,025/month (50% reduction)**

**Trade-off:** 2-4 hour processing delay (acceptable for overnight batch job)

### Scenario: Token Cost Forecast

**Given:**
- Current monthly consumption: 10B tokens
- Blended cost: $0.0015 per token
- Current monthly cost: $15,000
- Growth rate: 5% per month (feature launches, user growth)
- Price decline: 10% per year (historical trend)

**Question:** What will token costs be in 12 months without optimization?

**Calculation:**

```
Month 1: 10B tokens × $0.0015 = $15,000

Month 6:
Tokens: 10B × (1.05^5) = 12.76B
Price: $0.0015 × (1 - 0.10^(6/12)) = $0.00141
Cost: 12.76B × $0.00141 = $18,000

Month 12:
Tokens: 10B × (1.05^12) = 17.96B
Price: $0.0015 × (1 - 0.10) = $0.00135
Cost: 17.96B × $0.00135 = $24,200

Year 1 total spend: ~$230,000 (assuming linear growth within each month)
```

**With optimization (35% reduction target):**
- Effective tokens: 17.96B × (1 - 0.35) = 11.67B
- Cost: 11.67B × $0.00135 = $15,750
- **Savings: $8,450 in month 12 alone; $45,000+ across year**

| Mistral | Mistral Large | $2/1M | $6/1M | 128K | European compliance, EU hosting |

### Appendix B: Cost Calculation Templates

**Cost per request:**
```
Tokens per request = input_tokens + output_tokens
Cost per request = Tokens × (Input %, Output %) × (Input rate, Output rate)

Example: 2,000 input + 500 output, GPT-4o
Cost = (2,000 × $5/1M) + (500 × $15/1M)
     = $0.010 + $0.0075
     = $0.0175 per request
```

**Monthly cost forecast:**
```
Monthly cost = Daily requests × Cost per request × 30 days
            = 100,000 × $0.0175 × 30
            = $52,500/month
```

**Blended cost per token:**
```
Blended rate = Total cost / Total tokens
             = (Input tokens × Input rate + Output tokens × Output rate) / Total tokens

Example: 100B input, 20B output, GPT-4o
= (100B × $5/1M + 20B × $15/1M) / (100B + 20B)
= ($500K + $300K) / 120B
= $800K / 120B
= $0.00667 per token
```

## Conclusion

TokenOps is no longer optional at scale. Organizations that build TokenOps practices before the cost problem becomes a crisis benefit from:

1. **Controlled costs**: Visibility enables optimization without surprises
2. **Better decisions**: Unit economics connect cost to business impact
3. **Improved outcomes**: Optimization in service of quality, not just cost
4. **Cultural alignment**: Engineering and finance share a language and incentives

The organizations that master TokenOps will have the advantage in the AI era: the ability to deploy AI at scale, with full visibility and control, and at sustainable cost.

Start with baseline measurement. Move to instrumentation. Build allocation. Then optimize continuously.

The rest will follow.
